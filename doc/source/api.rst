Library API
-----------

libiio at its base is a C library. The API is designed to be as simple as possible, while still providing access to all the features of the IIO subsystem. Support for other languages is provided through bindings to the C API.

This section provides a detailed description of the C API. The API is divided into several categories, each of which is described in a separate page.
