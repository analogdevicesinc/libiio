# iiod: libiio Server Daemon

The `iiod` is a server daemon that provides a remote interface to the libiio library. It is designed to run on a Linux host, and can communicate with libiio clients over a network, USB, or serial link. For deeply embedded, resource-constrained systems, a separate server called `tiny-iiod` is available.
